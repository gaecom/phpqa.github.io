[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url | absolute_url }}) is a modern and intuitive testing framework for PHP.

<!--more--> 

A simple, modern and intuitive unit testing framework for PHP.

Just like SimpleTest or PHPUnit, atoum is a unit testing framework specific to the PHP language. However, it has been designed from the start up with the following ideas in mind:
* Can be implemented rapidly,
* Simplifies test development,
* Allows for writing reliable, readable, and clear unit tests.

It allows to run your tests in several [different modes](http://atoum.org/features.html#execution-engines):
in parallel, in concurrency, or simply one by one.
 
It also ships with several helping tools for a developer in their day-to-day usage.
