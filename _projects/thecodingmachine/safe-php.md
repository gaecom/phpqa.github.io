[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url | absolute_url }}) redeclares all core PHP functions. The new PHP functions act exactly as the old ones, except they throw exceptions properly when an error is encountered.

<!--more-->

The "safe" functions have the same name as the core PHP functions, except they are in the Safe namespace.

**Note**: {{ page.title }} can be integrated with both 
<a href="{{ site.projects | where: 'title', 'PHPStan - PHP Static Analysis Tool' | map: 'url' | first | absolute_url }}">PHPStan</a>
and <a href="{{ site.projects | where: 'title', 'Rector' | map: 'url' | first | absolute_url }}">Rector</a>.
